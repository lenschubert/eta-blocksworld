My transcripts of the blocks QA videos provided by Georgiy:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sH4R9n55IrJUSyJbILOcLcaS7UPnMwfV?usp=sharing

I sketchily checked whether the questions asked in the videos are also included 
below in Georgiy's made-up set (or transcripts). But only a smallish subset are
included, seemingly selected from Gene's, Ben's & especially Georgiy's own questions.
Or maybe that's coincidental.

A point about answering: Answers to yes-no questions and numeric questions
(especially when the answer is a small number) should explicitly supply
the evidence -- i.e., the block names -- that justify the answer. There
are many cases where one can disagree with a simple yes/no or "two" answer,
and the user should be made aware of the basis of the answer given!
